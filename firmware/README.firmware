The _no_pullup configurations adds an an additional check and specify ENTRY_POWER_ON as entrymode. 
No pullup only adds 16 to 18 bytes for an additional check (contained by default in all pre 2.0 versions) and can therefore be used for boards with a pullup.
ENTRY_POWER_ON adds 18 bytes, but is what you normally need if you use a Digispark board, since it is programmed by detaching from power and attaching to the USB port getting power again.
